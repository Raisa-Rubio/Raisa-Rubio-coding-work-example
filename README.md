# Raisa Rubio coding working sample - STATA

This work is part of the data analyis for my second-year thesis at Lund University. The thesis aimed at estimating the effects of both growth and income inequality on poverty in Peru. For that i used data from the National Household Survey spanning from 2007-2019. Unlike previous research for the country, it focuses on regional poverty dynamics highlighting the implications of regional idiosyncrasies and how they interplayed with the variables studied. It further looks at how growth and inequality affected the poor from a spatial dimension, that is, considering the marked differences between rural and urban poverty within regions.
